--------------------

This paper introduces **Diffusion Rejection Sampling (DiffRS)**, a new diffusion sampling approach that ensures alignment between the reverse transition and the true transition at each timestep.

The path with the green background represents the DiffRS sampling process, and the rightmost images are generated when the images are sampled as a base sampler without rejection from the intermediate image. Timesteps are expressed as the noise level Ïƒ from the EDM scheme.">

We sequentially apply the rejection sampling on the pre-trained transition kernel (red) to align the true transition kernel (blue). The acceptance probability is estimated by the time-dependent discriminator.">
